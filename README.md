# Election_Analysis
Election-Analysis is based on the Colorado board of elections, where we used Python software to help, Tom, audit the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. Our task included the following:
- Reporting the total number of votes cast
- Each county and its total vote count of votes
- Each county and its percentage of the total votes
- The county with the largest number of voters
- The percentage of votes for each candidate
- The total number of votes for each candidate 
- The winner of the election based on the popular vote
The output of the election results need to be printed on the terminal as well as a text file.

## Overview of Election Audit
In the Election Audit we used the dataset with three columns Ballot ID, County, Candidate and 369712 rows of election results in three county Jefferson,Denver and Arapahoe. There are three candidates running the election Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane.
